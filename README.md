# Movieably
Movieably is a movie app built with Javascript in React which allows users to interact with movies.
Users are able to view the most trending movies, learn more about different movies, search for a specific movie, sign up and log in, add movies to their favorites and know where to watch the trailer and the movie.
Movieably includes React components and has a plethora of CSS for styling and features.
Movieably also implements router redirects to redirect to new and different pages, and to sites for like for example youtube for movie trailer.
Movieably has a backend in Ruby on Rails and has movie data pulled from OMDB movie database. Have fun!
